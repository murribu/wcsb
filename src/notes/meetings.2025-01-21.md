## Work Session

The board held their monthly Work Session on Thursday, January 16.

There was only one voting item on the agenda, but the meeting was nearly 4 hours long. This is because the central office needs to make sure this new board understands the inner workings of the district. This week, they spent a good deal of time talking about Student Support Services, including an overview of [IDEA](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/), [[glossary.iep]]s, and [[glossary.504]].

There was also an update on the Textbook Adoption Plan. If you are interested in viewing the materials that are being considered, you may view them on Monday the 27th between noon and 6pm or Friday the 31st between 9am and 4pm. [Click here](https://www.wcs.edu/about-us/meetings) for more details.

Finally, they spoke about the Five Year Capital Plan. Since there were some board members who were surprised by its appearance on an agenda last year, they're giving a lot of lead time on budgetary items.

This was a VERY short meeting. [[people.board.Josh Brown]] was absent, so [[people.board.Dan Cash]] presided as Chair with a sparse leadership style. [[people.board.Jay Galbreath]] and [[people.board.Claire Reeves]] were also absent.

There were a few members of the public who spoke out against the book bans that happened last month. And some students touted the virtues of [DECA](https://www.deca.org/).

The one voting item was about Open Zoning. Basically, a Williamson County student may apply to attend a Williamson County school to which they are not zoned. Each school has a certain number of seats available for this open zoning, based on how close to capacity they are. This vote was to approve those numbers for each school. To see your school's numbers, [click here](https://meeting.boeconnect.net/Public/Agenda/566?meeting=671353) and find the "Open Zoned Schools 2025-26" link.
