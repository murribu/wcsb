[[people.board.Tonja Hibma]] was absent from this meeting as well.

Earlier in the month, on September 4th, the district hosted its annual presentation of the Family Life Curriculum. I was one of three members of the public who attended. Ms. Hibma was also in attendance. It was very similar to the presentation from last year, which you can read about [[here|meetings.2024-09-16]].

There were four topics from the school board meetings that stood out to me. First, the board elected a Chair and Vice Chair for this school year. Second, a public commenter returned to discuss how the district has dealt with his child receiving death threats. Third, they are beginning discussions about the next budget, including concerns regarding "class voluntary fees." And fourth, a WCS high school teacher was suspended pending an investigation into a social media post she allegedly made.

## New Vice Chair

[[people.board.Josh Brown]] was the only nominee for Chair, so he continues in his leadership role.

[[people.board.Claire Reeves]] was the only nominee for Vice Chair, so she will step into that role for [[people.board.Dan Cash]].

## Death Threat

As I wrote [[last month|meetings.2025-08-18]], a parent spoke about his dissatisfaction with how the district responded to his kid receiving death threats. He returned this month with some of his friends to speak on his behalf as well. There was some confusion when the first speaker asked to give his time to someone else. Mr. Brown conferred with counsel and decided not to allow this, so the speaker yielded his time. After the father finished, he claimed his friend had not been allowed to speak. In a rare moment, Mr. Brown directly rebutted him, clarifying that the other speaker was allowed but had chosen not to speak.

## Budget

It's very early in the budget process, but [[people.board.Jay Galbreath]] is beating the drum again for change to the way that "class voluntary fees" are treated. Basically, they are categorized poorly and it's not just semantics. It makes it so that schools have to beg for donations to cover classroom costs. He laid out the issue very clearly in the Work Session. You can see it by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PoPv-S-t20&t=1826s). The pertinent section is about 5 minutes long.

## Teacher Suspended For Social Media Post

Monday morning, a WCS teacher was suspended without pay pending an investigation into her social media post regarding Charlie Kirk's death. You can read the WKRN story [here](https://www.wkrn.com/news/local-news/williamson-county-school-employee-suspended-for-charlie-kirk-comments/). An important detail that is omitted from that story is that this post was intended for a private audience. Someone then took that private post and publicized it.

By my count, four or five members of the public spoke to encourage the board to terminate the teacher. One member of the public spoke to ask the board not to terminate her. This one member has a child in the teacher's class.

Mr. Golden clarified for everyone what the protocol will be for the investigation. The next step is to schedule a meeting with the teacher and her legal representation, if she chooses to have representation. What they hear in that meeting will drive the next steps.

It is my understanding that the superintendent will decide whether she receives disciplinary action, and what that action will be.

She will have an opportunity to appeal any decision. And I believe the school board is the body to hear that appeal. I'm not 100% sure of that, so if you have better information, please put it in the comments and I'll update this.

Mr. Golden repeatedly said that the post from the teacher does not reflect the values of Williamson County Schools. You can see the official statements at [this WKRN article](https://www.wkrn.com/news/local-news/williamson-county-school-employee-suspended-for-charlie-kirk-comments/amp/).

[[people.board.Dan Cash]] mentioned another incident involving a teacher saying something inappropriate in a classroom. That teacher has also been suspended without pay, pending an investigation.

## Next Meeting

The next meeting will be Monday, October 20, at 6:30pm. Your presence makes a difference.
