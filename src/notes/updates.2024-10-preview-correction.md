[[Yesterday's post|updates.2024-10-preview]] referenced a change to the dress code policy. My understanding that it was targeting gay and trans students was incorrect. This change was prompted by [[people.admin.Dana Ausbrooks]] to bring us in line with federal guidance. To hear her explanation, listen to the [policy meeting](https://docs.wcs.edu/pdf/meetings/September302024.mp3), starting at the 1:23:40 mark.
