The [agenda](https://meeting.boeconnect.net/Public/Agenda/566?meeting=657178) for the Thursday, October 17, 2024 Work Session has two components that are worth noting before the meeting.

## Dress Code Policy Change

UPDATE (10/16/24): The following interpretation was incorrect. See [[updates.2024-10-preview-correction]] for more context.

The second section of the dress code policy outlines messages that are not allowed on clothing, such as the advocation of violence or the use of drugs. The third bullet point under this section specifies the types of hate speech that are not allowed.

The current policy protects "groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious affiliation, or other protected classification." The proposed change would replace "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" with merely "sex."

If I'm understanding this correctly, it actively removes hate speech protection from our gay and trans students. At the very least, it sends the message that our district does not wish to acknowledge hate speech based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

This change will be for "first and final reading" - which means this has been fast-tracked. Usually for a policy change, they will have a [[glossary.first reading]] vote and then the next month will be "second reading" which finalizes it.

## Revision of the Board's Stance on Vouchers

Item #7 on the agenda reads, "Topic for Discussion: Board Member request for reconsideration of March 2024 Board resolution on Education Freedom Scholarship ACT Legislation"

In March of 2024, the board [passed a resolution](https://www.williamsonherald.com/news/local_news/wcs-board-passes-resolution-against-school-vouchers/article_973b41ba-e6dc-11ee-afff-9f13dab05abc.html) denouncing the possibility of a voucher program in Tennessee. It passed by a vote of seven to five. Only two of the seven board members who voted in favor of the resolution are still on the board.

Presumably, the new make-up of the board is more amenable to the idea of a state-wide voucher program and is looking to rescind that resolution from 7 months ago.

## Call to Action
