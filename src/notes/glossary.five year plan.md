The Five Year Plan is a document that the school board establishes each year. It is a guess about how much money the district will likely need over the next five years. It goes into some detail about when and where the money would be spent. It is non-binding, and delivered to the [[glossary.county commission]] to give them a heads-up regarding the upcoming budget requests.

This plan is a integral part of maintaining the county's excellent bond rating. Without the five year plan, the county's bond rating would likely fall, which would make it more expensive for the county to borrow money.
