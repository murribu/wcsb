If a policy update is a minor change, or merely one to bring the district in line with a new law, or is particularly time-sensitive, it may be marked as "first and final."
This means that it will not go through the typical cycle of having a [[glossary.first reading]] vote one month and then its enshrinement the next month. Instead, the board only votes once to expedite the process.
