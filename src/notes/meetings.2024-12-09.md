## Book Restrictions

The board met to vote on whether and how to restrict five books. The board determined that three books should be removed entirely from Williamson County Schools:

- [Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4588.Extremely_Loud_Incredibly_Close)
- [The Perks of Being a Wallflower](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22628.The_Perks_of_Being_a_Wallflower)
- [Where the Crawdads Sing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36809135-where-the-crawdads-sing)

One book was restricted to only be available to 11th and 12th graders: [The Field Guide to the North American Teenager](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36284785-the-field-guide-to-the-north-american-teenager)

And one book was removed from middle schools, but remains in high schools: [Speak](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39280444-speak?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_5)

There was a lot of good discussion amongst the board that was specific to each book (except for Perks - there was no discussion for that one). [[people.board.Eric Welch]] and [[people.board.Melissa Wyatt]] voted against each restriction. [[people.board.Dan Cash]] and [[people.board.Drason Beasley]] joined them in voting against restricting Speak to only high schools.

There were more police officers than normal and the audience was palpably energetic.

By my count, 14 people from the community spoke in favor of removing these books and 11 spoke in favor of keeping them.

Notably, [[people.pol.Gino Bulso]] was present. He is a current TN state representative who helped pass the new TN law that guided these restriction. He also is the legal representation for the parents who sued the school to restrict these books.

## Next Meeting

The next scheduled board meeting will be Tuesday, January 21st, 2025.
