## Election Day

Election Day is August 1st. If you have not early voted yet, please show up to vote this Thursday. Here is a map with all of the Williamson County voting locations: [link](https://williamsontn.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=0689b8eaf82d4f38bdf20130a53fbf22). Each location will open at 7am and close at 7pm.

If you live in an odd-numbered district (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11), you can vote for a school board candidate. To find your district, go to [https://tncot.cc/tndistrict](https://tncot.cc/tndistrict) and type in your address. Your "County Commission District" is the same as your School Board District.

## More Surveys

I discovered two more publicly available candidate surveys.

[[organizations.Wilco Iris]] published their survey and you can find it here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bwVm62hYOeFqwggx3oYFw_h-I6fRxK2IoqBQLApC1Xc/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bwVm62hYOeFqwggx3oYFw_h-I6fRxK2IoqBQLApC1Xc/mobilebasic).

Also, The News TN published their Q&A here: [https://www.thenewstn.com/schools/williamson-county-school-board-election-ramping-up-with-start-of-early-voting/article_7c14cd10-406f-11ef-869d-a786868d5e4d.html](https://www.thenewstn.com/schools/williamson-county-school-board-election-ramping-up-with-start-of-early-voting/article_7c14cd10-406f-11ef-869d-a786868d5e4d.html).

I also edited my previous update to include these links.

As always, reach out if you see something wrong or if you just want to chat.
