This is a monthly recurring meeting that usually occurs the Monday before the [[glossary.Work Session]]. In this meeting, the policy committee discusses upcoming proposed policy changes and prepares recommendations for the rest of the board. Any board member may attend, but only those on the policy committee are expected to be there.
