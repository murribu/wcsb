## Recess

Ten folks spoke about the need to increase the amount of recess time our kids get. They cited many studies that show the benefits of additional unstructured play time. They seemed to converge around the idea of having one hour of recess during a school day.

[[people.admin.Jason Golden]] said that the TN state standard is 15 minutes of recess, which he thinks is too low. Generally at WCS, we're averaging 20-30 minutes.

## Supplemental Pay for Arts Teachers

Seven folks signed up to speak about the discrepancy between fine arts teachers' supplemental pay versus athletic coaches' supplemental pay. Six of the speakers were students and they were all fantastic!

Mr. Golden addressed this issue later in the meeting. In response to the persistent outcry, he added to his goals for the coming year. He hopes to "identity opportunities to access alternative funding sources for WCS academic, arts, and athletic programming."

## Calendar

Two people signed up to speak about the school calendar. The way the WCS calendar is set up, if a family has a custody plan that alternates weeks, the same parent will have the kids for fall break and spring break.

Mr. Golden addressed this later, saying that there are unintended consequences of accommodating this type of a custody plan. It may solve the problem for some, but create problems for others. So they focus on optimizing for education when forming the calendar. It is better for students and teachers to have fall break and spring break occur between quarters.

## Five Year Plan

Every November, the board votes on a [[glossary.five year plan]]. This is a non-binding guess about how much money the district will need over the next five years. Once approved, it is sent on to the county commission for their perusal in January.

[[people.board.Jay Galbreath]] asked to add some commentary to the Five Year Plan to show when each line item was added or changed. [[people.admin.Jason Golden]] and [[people.board.Claire Reeves]] agreed that this was a good idea.

[[people.board.Tony Bostic]] and [[people.board.Margie Johnson]] expressed surprise and consternation about having to vote on this plan, saying that they weren't sure where these numbers came from.

[[people.board.Donna Clements]] expressed concern that the numbers were too high. She cited the growth in our county that has leveled off over the past 4 years or so, saying that we might not need so many new schools.

[[people.board.Josh Brown]] addressed the concerns, imploring the skeptical board members to collaborate and fix the problems they mentioned rather than vote against the Five Year Plan. If this plan were not to pass, it could have major negative financial implications for the county.

Even still, [[people.board.Tony Bostic]] voted against the plan. [[people.board.Donna Clements]] and [[people.board.Margie Johnson]] abstained, which is effectively a "no" vote, since it needs 7 "yes" votes to pass. Fortunately, the other 9 board members voted in favor of the Five Year Plan, so it passed.

## Equal Opportunity Employment Policy

Last month, [[people.admin.Dana Ausbrooks]] recommended adding a footnote to the EOE policy, referencing [Bostock v. Clayton County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bostock_v._Clayton_County). This was initially a tiny change and so it was going to be fast-tracked via a [[glossary.first and final]] vote. [[people.board.Donna Clements]] asked for it to go through the usual [[glossary.first reading]] process. In the intervening weeks, the change was expanded to move the words "pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender identity" into a parenthetical statement after the word "sex." This closely mirrors the federal [EEOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Employment_Opportunity_Commission) language.

There are a few board members who have expressed interest in removing the subclasses from the policy all together. Namely, [[people.board.Donna Clements]], [[people.board.Claire Reeves]], and [[people.board.Tony Bostic]]. So last night, Dr. Reeves proposed an amendment to do just that. It's important to note that this change wasn't an agenda item, so the public was not notified that this would be voted on.

In the ensuing discussion, [[people.board.Eric Welch]] polled the attorneys in the room for their recommendation about this amendment. [[people.admin.Dana Ausbrooks]] explained (for at least the 4th time) that the removal of these terms would increase the district's risk and liability. [[people.admin.Vickie Hall]] said that this change is concerning, and that it would alienate some of our employees. [[people.admin.Jason Golden]] also recommended not removing the terms. It was also stressed that the district is bound by law to provide Equal Opportunity protection for these classes of people, whether it's in the policy or not.

Mr. Welch went on to point out that this change would be a departure from the established norm of using language from federal guidance when implementing policies to adhere to federal laws.

The argument in favor of removing these terms seemed to coalesce around the possibility that the board will need to change the policy again if the federal guidance changes.

By a vote of 9-3, the board increased liability for the district, flew in the face of how board policy has historically been derived, and went against the recommendation of the district's counsel by removing the terms "sexual orientation," "gender identity," and "pregnancy" from the Equal Opportunity Employment policy. [[people.board.Melissa Wyatt]], [[people.board.Eric Welch]], and [[people.board.Drason Beasley]] voted against this change.
