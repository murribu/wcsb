There were two meetings of note yesterday: the Family Life Curriculum meeting and the regularly scheduled School Board meeting.

## Family Life Curriculum meeting

At the Williamson County Professional Development Center, [[people.admin.Dave Allen]] led a meeting where the public could come peruse the Family Life curriculum that the district uses.

There were around 20 or so community members who showed up. We were each greeted individually and presented with a copy of the pertinent TN laws that govern what can and must be taught in the Family Life Curriculum.

Around the room, there were 5 main stations: elementary, high school, 6th grade, 7th grade, and 8th grade. Each station had at least one counselor whom I could ask questions.

At the elementary table, we had the opportunity to watch short animated videos that teach kids about boundaries.

At each of the other tables, there was a binder with printed out powerpoint slides of what the students will see in this curriculum. For 6th and 7th grade, it seemed to concentrate on hygene and what to expect from puberty. In 8th grade, it started talking about abstinence and contraceptives. These materials are not posted publicly because they are copyrighted.

There is a recent TN law that requires a three-minute, computer-generated video about human embryonic development. Here is a link to the video that our district uses to fulfill that requirement: https://www.britannica.com/video/192622/Human-embryonic-development-birth-fertilization.

The internet was down, so they could not use their electronic method of voting. That meant that all votes were voice votes.

### New Board Members

Mayor [[people.pol.Rogers Anderson]] swore in the 6 new board members: [[people.board.Tony Bostic]], [[people.board.Margie Johnson]], [[people.board.Melissa Wyatt]], [[people.board.Claire Reeves]], and [[people.board.Tonja Hibma]]. Technically, [[people.board.Dennis Driggers]] was already sworn in, but he participated in this event as well.

### New Leadership

#### Chair

The board needed to elect a new chair and vice chair. [[people.board.Eric Welch]] nominated [[people.board.Drason Beasley]], while [[people.board.Dan Cash]] nominated [[people.board.Josh Brown]]. Mr. Welch was the only vote for Mr. Beasley. All eleven of the other board members (including Mr. Beasley) voted for Mr. Brown.

#### Vice Chair

[[people.board.Drason Beasley]] nominated [[people.board.Jay Galbreath]], who declined the nomination. Then Mr. Galbreath nominated [[people.board.Dan Cash]]. [[people.board.Tony Bostic]] nominated [[people.board.Margie Johnson]]. Mr. Cash won that vote, 8-4. The four who voted for Dr. Johnson were [[people.board.Tony Bostic]], [[people.board.Margie Johnson]] herself, [[people.board.Melissa Wyatt]], and [[people.board.Eric Welch]].

### Public Comment

I introduced the new board to the work of [[organizations.OneWillco]].

There were 5 middle schoolers and 2 adults who again addressed the inequity in supplemental pay for fine arts teachers.

And [[people.o.Angela Frederick]] introduced the board to the work of the [[organizations.WCEA]].

### Voting Items

All of the votes were unanimous. The only real contention was [[people.board.Margie Johnson]] musing that we should consider reducing the number of built-in snow days. We currently allow for 10 and we don't usually use them all. She was also concerned about whether we pay school-based employees when there are snow days. The short answer seemed to be that its moot for salaried employees and hourly employees are paid for the hours that they actually work.

The rest of the meeting was rather uneventful. They revisited and codified some of the points of discussion from [[Thursdays Work Session|meetings.2024-09-12]], so review that for more context.

The next school board meeting will be Monday, October 21st.
