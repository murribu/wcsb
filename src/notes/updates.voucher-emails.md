I submitted a [[glossary.public records request]] to see all emails that were sent to or from any school board member regarding vouchers or the rescinding of the voucher resolution from March of 2024. I received a 253-page PDF. I tallied up the emails, and you can find some data below.

```

```

`Anti` = Number of emails the representative received encouraging them NOT to rescind the anti-voucher resolution

`Pro` = Number of emails asking them to rescind the anti-voucher resolution

`Replies` = how many people the representative replied to

`Voted` = If "Yes", this representative voted to rescind the anti-voucher resolution. If "No", they voted not to rescind it.

I asked for emails from Monday, October 14 through Monday, October 21. If the representative replied on Tuesday, the 22nd or later (and I know some did), those are not counted in these totals. I asked for this timeframe because I was more interested in any correspondence prior to the meeting.

Sixty-one people emailed the whole board while many others emailed just one representative, leading to the discrepancies between the board members' totals.

It is important to note that the public had approximately 72 hours of notice about this vote.

There was only one constituent who emailed the whole board asking them to rescind the anti-voucher resolution. That was [[people.pol.Barb Sturgeon]]. Of course, she is a county commissioner from District 8. She spoke for the residents of her district, saying that "the majority of them did not support [the anti-voucher resoltuion]." Notably in her email, Ms. Sturgeon misspelled [[people.board.Eric Welch]]'s name as "Welsh." He replied to her, "My last name is spelled Welch, with a CH like 'charged' and not an sh like 'shackled.'" She replied, apologizing for the misspelling.

For the majority of our school board representatives, if they are being influenced to vote one way or another, it's clearly not via emails from their constituents.
