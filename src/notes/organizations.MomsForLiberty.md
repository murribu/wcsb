## Souther Poverty Law Center

"Moms for Liberty is a far-right organization that engages in anti-student inclusion activities and self-identifies as part of the modern parental rights movement. The group grew out of opposition to public health regulations for COVID-19, opposes LGBTQ+ and racially inclusive school curriculum, and has advocated books bans." - [SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/moms-liberty)
