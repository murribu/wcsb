The main theme of the meeting was welcoming and orienting the new board members. There were some other notable moments as well though.

## Welcoming New Board Members

Because of the TN legislature's decision to allow school board races to be partisan, we now have 6 new board members. It is unusual to have this level of turn over, so [[people.admin.Jason Golden]] began by going around the room for introductions. He also gave a susinct, 101-level overview of what the role of the board is, including the process by which the board will elect a board chair and vice chair on Monday.

He then transitioned into speaking about the viral mis-information problem about "targeted" schools. In that context, he emphasized that a threat to harm 2 or more people at school is now a zero-tolerance offense. This means that if someone is found to have made a valid threat, there is a mandatory one-year suspension.

[[people.board.Dennis Driggers]] asked for an update on the "two students who were arrested last month and now there’s a lawsuit against us." He was told that that conversation would likely include legal advice and so it would need to be in a closed-door meeting. It took a couple of times to hear this message before he understood. Here is the story I believe he’s referring to:

## Family Life Cirriculum

The board discussed the annual family life cirriculum meeting. This is an opportunity for members of the public to view the family life cirriculum that is taught to 1st, 4th, 7th, and 9th grade students. The cirriculum is largely based on TN state law. For more info, you can read about [Erin's Law](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/education/health-&-safety/Erins_Law_Guidelines_2022_Final.pdf). The meeting will be held at 5pm this Monday evening at 1761 West Main Street Franklin TN 37064.

## Textbook Adoption Process

It is time for the district to adopt new science and math textbooks. [[people.admin.Jen Sower]] gave a thorough presentation on the textbook adoption process. There is a committee that is made up of teachers and parents who will review the textbooks that are being considered for adoption. Once the recommendations have been made, there will be open meetings for the public to come and review the textbooks. Those meetings will likely happen in January and February.

## Miscellaneous

The board also discussed the scheduling of their annual board retreat, the 25-26 budget, and the 25-26 school calendar. The budget and calendar discussions are very preliminary at this point.

## Monday's Board Meeting

The [agenda](https://meeting.boeconnect.net/Public/Agenda/566?meeting=654966) for Monday's meeting looks to be fairly straightforward. The most excitement will likely come from the election of the chair and vice chair.

I will be speaking on Monday to introduce the new board members to the work of [[organizations.OneWillco]]. If you're available, come join me!
